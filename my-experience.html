            Hi, I'm Andrew, and I'm a CS major at the University of Maryland. Almost all of my classes through high school and college thus far have used traditional 
            grading formats, so I have experienced first-hand some of the side effects traditional grading causes. I have always been good at and interested in
            math and science classes. Throughout much of high school, I found these classes to be not too challenging, so my interest didn't waver much, but there were
            some exceptions. In my Honors Biology class, we had many difficult exams where you essentially had to memorize the notes in order to do well, and this greatly hampered
            my enjoyment of the subject, even though this is a sort of topic I would normally find myself interested in. While my interest in the subject was greatly hampered by these
            exams, one saving grace was that we had several graded projects without a ruberic where we got to create things like songs and animations to explain a topic, and I found
            these assignments greatly enjoyable. 
            <br><br> 
            In my AP Phyiscs a class, there was a similar situation. Due to the difficulty of the course, we were expected to get Ds on exams which would then be curved up to a more
            reasonable grade. Similar to my bio class, this greatly hampered my interest in the subject as a whole as I was more panicked about improving my grade than the content iteslf.
            The next year, I was going to take the next AP Physics class, but due to a schedule conflict, I instead had to take an experimental new physics class. In this class, it was clear
            the teacher was very interested in learning new things and trying things out and that was reflected greatly in his teaching style. This class was one of my only un-grading experiences.
            We essentially had no formally graded assignments, and instead he would teach us new topics and then let us work on our own projects that deal with these topics, and our grades were
            based on our efforts doing these projects. I learned a lot in this class about electricity and circuits, and I was actually excited to go to class every time and was engaged
            in the content. Unfortunately, the pandemic essentially put a halt to this class's progress since it was hard to work on these projects outside of school.
            <br><br> Prior to college, I have done a lot of personal CS projects in my free time, including making simple games, websites, utility programs to solve a problem I had, and my friend
            and I even started making minecraft plugins. I also was the lead programmer on my HS robotics team so I worked in Java a lot for that. All of this is to say that I greatly
            enjoy programming, and also was fond of the programming languages I used, primarily Java. Once I got to college, I noticed something. I noticed that in my Java class,
            many students seemed to have a strong distaste for the language, and I believe this was primarily because of the stressful exams in the course hurting people's interest
            and perception of the language. I think this is very unfortunate since this could affect their future interestes in CS as a whole as they continue to go through school,
            and I would hope that instead the opposite would occurr. 
            <br><br> All of this is to say that I have seen and experienced some of the negative consequences of grading first-hand and I know there's a way to address it.
