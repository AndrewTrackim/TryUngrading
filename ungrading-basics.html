          When it comes to ungrading, there isn't just one set thing I can tell you that would fully encompass what it means to ungrade or how to ungrade. Ungrading really is
          exactly what it sounds like: removing or de-emphasizing grades from your class. There are a number of ways of accomplishing it and I obviously can't cover all 
          of the different methods educators have tried over the years, so I'll describe some of the ones that stuck out to me. Although the goal of ungrading is to get rid of grades
          most schools would not be okay with a professor just deciding not to grade students in their class, so most of these techniques still involve assigning at least a final
          letter grade.
          <br> <br>
          When ungrading classes, an increased emphasis should be put on providing students with feedback on their work. Proponents of grades often insist grades are 
          important for providing students with feedback on the quality of their work, but the type of feedback grades provide is much less beneficial than written feedback
          without a grade. A <a href="https://mrbartonmaths.com/resourcesnew/8.%20Research/Marking%20and%20Feedback/Task-Involving%20and%20Ego-Involving%20Properties%20of%20Evaluation.pdf">study by Ruth Butler</a>
          shows that receiving comments as feedback showed more interest in the class and scored better on divergent(creative) thinking tests. Because of this,
          essentially all methods of ungrading rely on feedback. Instead of simply being given a grade as feedback or a grade along with written feedback, providing purely written/verbal
          feedback to students is the most effective in improving their future work. 
          <br> <br>  
          One approach to ungrading that is very popular is basing the final letter grade on student reflection. Different teachers tackle the reflection approach in different ways but generally,
          they all use the same basic principle. Students are to think back over their coursework and the feedback they've received and use it to form some sort of grade for themselves
          that will end up in the gradebook. One notable name in the ungrading world is <a href="https://www.jessestommel.com/how-to-ungrade/">Jesse Stommel</a>.
          In his class, "students write self-reflections 2-3 times throughout the term." Each reflection serves a different purpose; the first one focuses on more specific questions
          whereas the last one is more like an essay. He uses this order to "give students space to figure out how to do this work as they go." since this type of reflection is difficult 
          for most students. One side effect of this method is that Stommel believes that he is able to see his students as complex and committed due to the self-reflections he reads.
          <br> <br>
          The two things I covered so far go hand in hand. The teachers give feedback that guides the students' development through the course which they will later reflect on. They then
          can discuss the entire course with the professor or get feedback on their reflections and ultimately they can decide on a grade. There are many ways you can adjust the way you
          decide on a grade; you can let your students decide, you can discuss their reflection with them and decide a grade together, or you can come up with your own balance. There is no one
          correct way to do this, and you may need to adjust things based on the policies where you're teaching. 
          <br><br> 
          This reflection and feedback model is all well and good, but how could you do this sort of thing in a math or chemistry class? Things get more complicated once you start 
          looking into STEM classes since these subjects generally seem more cut and dry compared to essays and projects. There is still a way to de-emphasize grading in your class though!
          The main tool for ungrading in these classes is revision. Sure a student may have gotten a question objectively wrong, but why do we have to leave it at that? Instead of just having
          an exam and that's the grade, you can incorporate revision into your class to give students an opportunity to better understand what they got wrong and learn from it instead
          of seeing the grade and never looking at it again. This is exactly what <a href="https://clarissasorensenunruh.com/2020/07/03/so-you-wanna-ungrade-the-practical-guide/">
            Clarissa Sorensen-Unruh</a> does in her chemistry classes. You can see an <a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/16en3kzIpy9ZBjnRgFf-jBw2Zh89yq_jV/view">
          example rubric </a> from her class here. She doesn't include grades on the exam, instead marking which questions they did incorrectly. She then allows students to try 
          to figure out what they did wrong and improve their work. They also get to provide the number of points they believe they should have earned on the question. Since these 
          questions have objectively right and wrong final answers, it would be hard to entirely remove grades from this class, but she still manages to incorporate feedback, reflection, and 
          revision into her exams which is a very good step in the right direction. I believe this same tactic could easily be applied to math classes as well.
          <br> <br> 
          Another popular STEM major is Computer Science (hey, that's my major!), and sure enough, similar principles can be applied here too! Christopher K. Riesbeck is a cs professor
          at Northwestern University, and he has experience ungrading his cs classes. He specifically uses what he calls "do-review-redo" assignments. With this structure, students write
          and submit their code, and once they receive feedback, they will then improve their program and fix any problems. This process repeats until there is nothing left to critique.
          This process promotes comment-based feedback which is important for creative thinking and improvement as mentioned earlier. Students don't receive a grade on these assignments. 
          The final grade in the class is determined by three factors: progress, quality, and effort. There is a lot that goes into each of these categories which can be found <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/2732937/pdf">
          here</a>, but to summarize each, progress measures how much a student did and how much variety and difficulty they took on, quality measures how good their code was by the end,
          and effort is based on how often they submit and how hard did they push themself. These guidelines can be adapted for any STEM course that is project-based.
          <br> <br>
          There are more ways to ungrade your class, but the methods I've mentioned here are a solid foundation for how to ungrade your class. If you are still unsure about ungrading,
          just look at <a href="https://www.hampshire.edu/discover-hampshire/our-academic-philosophy#:~:text=Hampshire%20Uses%20Narrative%20Evaluations%20Instead,feedback%20on%20papers%20and%20projects.">
          Hampshire College</a> for an example of ungrading in action. Hampshire College does not have grades but instead has "Narrative Evaluations"  which provide students
          with constructive feedback on their work. This model encourages students to actually want to learn, experiment, get creative, and take risks. 
          <br> <br>
          I hope I was able to convince you of the merits of ungrading. I believe that if you truly want your students to love learning and engage in your courses' content, you should
          attempt to incorporate ungrading.
