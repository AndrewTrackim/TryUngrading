          When it comes to ungrading, there isn't just one set thing I can tell you that would fully ecompass what it means to ungrade or how to ungrade. Ungrading really is
          exactly what it sounds like: removing or de-emphasizing grades from your class. There are a number of ways of accomplishing it and I obviously can't cover all 
          of the different methods educators have tried over the years, so I'll describe some of the ones that stuck out to me. Although the goal of ungrading is to get rid of grades
          most schools would not be okay with a professor just deciding not to grade students in their class, so most of these techniques still involve assigning at least a final
          letter grade.
          <br> <br>
          When ungrading classes, an increased emphasis should be put on providing students with feedback on their work. Proponents of grades often insist grades are 
          important for providing students with feedback on the quality of their work, but the type of feedback grades provide is much less benificial than written feedback
          without a grade. A <a href="https://mrbartonmaths.com/resourcesnew/8.%20Research/Marking%20and%20Feedback/Task-Involving%20and%20Ego-Involving%20Properties%20of%20Evaluation.pdf">study by Ruth Butler</a>
          shows that recieving comments as feedback showed more interest in the class and scored better on divergent(creative) thinking tests. Because of this,
          essentially all methods of ungrading rely on feedback. Instead of simply being given a grade as your feedback or a grade along with written feedback, providing purely written/verbal
          feedback to students is the most effective in improving their future work. 
          <br> <br>  
          One approach to ungrading that is very popular is basing the final letter grade on student reflection. Different teachers tackle the reflection approach in different ways but generally,
          they all use the same basic principle. Students are to think back over their coursework and the feedback they've recived and use it to form some sort of grade for themselves
          that will end up in the gradebook. One notable name in the ungrading world is <a href="https://www.jessestommel.com/how-to-ungrade/">Jesse Stommel</a>.
          In his class, "students write self-reflections 2-3 times throguhout the term." Each reflection serves a different purpose; the first one focuses on more specific questions
          whereas the last one is more like an essay. He uses this order to "give students space to figure out how to do this work as they go." since this type of reflection is difficult 
          for most students. One side effect of this method is that Stommel believes that he is able to see his students as complex and committed due to the self reflections he reads.
          <br> <br>
          The two things I covered so far go hand in hand. The teachers give feeback that guides the students development through the course which they will later reflect on. They then
          can discuss the entire course with the professor or get feedback on their reflections and ultimately they can decide on a grade. There are many ways you can adjust the way you
          decide on a grade; you can let them decide, you can discuss their reflection with them and decide a grade together, or you can come up with your own balance. There is no one
          correct way to do this, and you may need to adjust things based on the policies where you're teaching. 
          <br><br> 
          This reflection and feedback model is all well and good, but how could you do this sort of thing in a math or chemistry class? Things get more complicated once you start 
          looking into STEM classes since these subjects generally seem more cut and dry compared to essays and projects. There is still a way to de-emphasize grading in your class though!
          The main tool for ungrading in these classes is revision. Sure you may have gotten a question objectively wrong, but why do we have to leave it at that? Instead of just having
          an exam and that's your grade, you can incorporate revision into your class to give students an opportunity to better understand what they got wrong and learn from it instead
          of seeing the grade and never looking at it again.
