              When you hear the term "un-grading," you may be off-put by the implication that there's a problem with the current grading system.
              We've been grading forever at this point and it seems to have been working fine, so what is even the problem with grading?
              There are actually a number of factors that lead to a lower quality of learning strictly <i>because</i> of grading! 
              <br> <br>
              One of the biggest issues is in regards to motivation. As <a href="http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/oct94/vol52/num02/Grading@-The-Issue-Is-Not-How-But-Why.aspx">
              Alfie Kohn states</a>, “The trouble lies with the implicit assumption that 
              there exists a single entity called 'motivation' that students have”. There are two types of motivation that humans have: intrinsic 
              motivation extrinsic motivation. The results of students’ learning is vastly different based on which type of motivation is at 
              work. Intrinsic motivation can be seen as doing something because you want to whereas extrinsic motivation is more like doing something 
              for a reward or to avoid punishment. <a href="https://www.academia.edu/24744214/College_student_intrinsic_and_or_extrinsic_motivation_and_learning">In the context of college</a>, “intrinsic motivation involves interest in the subject matter, enjoyment 
              of challenge, or a sense of making progress and increasing mastery,” whereas extrinsic motivation is most obviously in the form of 
              grades. Yi-Guang Lin’s study found that high intrinsic motivation leads to better performance compared to high extrinsic motivation. 
              They also found that moderate levels of extrinsic motivation is better than a high level. 
              <br><br>
              Where is this difference in performance coming from? Many studies have found that having high intrinsic motivation can lead to a decrease 
              in interest.

    <div class ="row" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
        <div class="col">
            <p style="font-size: 20px; padding-left: 11%;"> <br> <br>
              For example, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1129327?seq=7#metadata_info_tab_contents">a study byVonnie C. McLoyd</a> found that kids were more likely to spend more time reading an interesting story when 
              there was no reward being given to them. This shows that they were intrinsically motivated to read more. They read much less of the book when
              given a reward as extrinsic motivation. On the other hand, the kids spent more time on a low-interest activity when they were being rewarded.

        <div class="col">
            <img src="graph.png" style="width: 290px; height: px;">
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class = "row">
        <div class = "col" style="padding-left: 7%; padding-right: 7%;">
          <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            The important takeaway from this experiment is that providing extrinsic motivation will lead people to be less interested in the subject matter.
            When your goal switches from wanting to learn to just getting a good grade, you will focus on what needs to be done to get that grade instead 
            of what you want to learn or do. 
            <br><br>
            In addition to reducing interest in the subject, grades can also lead students to take fewer risks. When students are expecting to receive a grade, 
            they gain a <a href="https://www.thnk.org/blog/3-reasons-grades-bad-education/">fear of failure</a>. This leads students to avoid difficult subjects 
            and instead take classes where they feel they are the most likely to get 
            an A. <a href="https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/case-grades/">Alfie Kohn explains</a> that humans are rational, so they’ll pick a task that makes them the most likely to receive a good grade instead of 
            challenging themselves which could lead to failure. 
            <br><br>
            TLDR, the current grading system works against the goals we have for students. We want students to be interested in subject matter and become 
            lifelong learners, but grading leads students to have less interest in what they are learning. In addition, grades cause students to take fewer 
            risks in the classes they take as well as in the assignments they complete. Because of these findings, I believe that we should move away from 
            traditional grading systems.
