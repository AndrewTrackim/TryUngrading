	<h1>Explanation</h1>
	<p>Ungrading is a concept where teachers move away from a traditional grading system, usually in favor of a more feedback and communicative approach.<br> According to Professor Jennifer Hurley, grading isn't very satisfying for teachers because they try to give thoughtful feedback, but students only care <br> about the number, ignoring the feedback. She also explains how sometimes people are too embarrassed or scared to look at the feedback after seeing their grade.<br> Professor Hurley has noted that students will try to do the bare minimum to get an A just to play it safe. She also believes that her students work harder when they aren't <br> being graded. 
		
	<br><br> According to Colleen Flaherty, colleges are often resistant to ungrading because it goes against the "culture of assessment", and it is scary to suddenly transition to gradeless. <br>According to a scholarly article by Jeffrey Schinske and Kimberly Tanner, grades motivate students extrinsically by making them afraid of punishment or shame. They explain<br> that grades lessen intrinsic motivation, and the fear created by grades reduces interest and enjoyment of classwork. This is the main concept I played upon in my game, because <br> I have personally experienced this in some of my classes in subjects that I actually enjoy. They also explained that fear also causes students to avoid challenges. I also included <br>this idea in the game by making it much riskier to get a 3-pointer. Ultimately there are many negative side effects of grading, and students often get more out of their classes<br> if they aren't being graded and are instead given feedback.<br><br>
		
	So what do we replace grades with? In her online video conference, Starr Sackstein, a highschool teacher, explains her system for un-grading. She believes that using a portfolio<br> instead of traditional exams and grades is effective. Students can pick projects they want to include in their portfolio and can explain why they picked specific assignments. <br>She also believes that teachers should make their classes more project-based since projects allow stronger teacher-to-student feedback. She states that teachers and students should <br>have ongoing conversations so they are on the same page about the course expectations, and one way students can receive feedback is with reports of how the teacher assesses their <br>skills in key areas. This would be comment based feedback of course. There are a lot of things that teachers could do to replace grading in their classes.
